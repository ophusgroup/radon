# radon
differential cuda functions for radon transforms.

This package is more generally a testing ground for integrating cuda and cpp functions into our python packages. Once we have implemented the basic radon functionality and package building here, we will move it into Quantem. Later on we will also (hopefully) write the generalized projection operator, though this could be done directly in Quantem.
